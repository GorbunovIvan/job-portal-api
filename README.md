### üöÄ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GorbunovIvan/job-portal-api
cd job-portal-api
```

#### 2. Run with Docker Compose

Make sure you have Docker installed.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts:

* Spring Boot app
* PostgreSQL database

Update your `application.yml` to point to a local PostgreSQL + Kafka instance.

Then:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
